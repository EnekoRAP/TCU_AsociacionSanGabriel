# Asociación San Gabriel Formación y Cuido de Niños

This web application was developed to manage information and data administration for the population served by the San Gabriel Childcare and Training Association. Built with Apache, CSS, HTML, Javascript, PHP, SCSS, and SQL, the platform will benefit the Association's administrative staff and the children it serves by providing modules for managing users, beneficiaries, groups, and programs, as well as handling audit errors.
